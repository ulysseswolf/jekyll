## multiple rows to one row
SELECT userID, username, fName, GROUP_CONCAT(stratNames SEPARATOR ', ') AS strats
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN  uts on uts.userID = u.userID
LEFT JOIN s on uts.stratID  = s.stratID  
GROUP BY userID, username, fName

## mysql LIKE multiple values 
{% highlight python %}
SELECT * from fiberbox where field REGEXP '1740|1938|1940';

## insert or update
Use INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE

ALTER table ADD UNIQUE (column)
INSERT INTO table (id, name, age) VALUES(1, "A", 19) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE    
name="A", age=19

You can automatically convert an invalid date to the valid equivalent like this:

SELECT '2008-02-31' + INTERVAL 0 DAY;
# 2008-03-02

This lets you avoid storing invalid dates without bothering the user and without having to manually program a fix into your app. I suppose in >=5.0.2, you'd have to enable ALLOW_INVALID_DATES to avoid having it converted to '0000-00-00'. This also works with DATETIMEs.

if you add 0 month to an invalid date, you could get last day of the month, for example:   

SELECT '2008-02-31' + INTERVAL 0 MONTH;
# 2008-02-29

It works as
SELECT LAST_DAY('2008-02-31');
# 2008-02-29

find the mysql data directory from command line:
mysql -uroot -proot -e 'SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_Name LIKE "%dir"

delete join, need to specify that you want to delete the entries from the posts table:

DELETE posts
FROM posts
INNER JOIN projects ON projects.project_id = posts.project_id
WHERE projects.client_id = ?

having:
having用来弥补where在分组数据判断的不足，对分组数据再次判断需要用having
find duplicate rows based on multiple fields in MySQL:
id | title   | time  | domain
32   title1    12:30   domain1.com
33   title1    12:30   domain2.com
34   title2    14:20   domain1.com
35   title3    14:30   domain2.com
36   title1    12:30   domain55.com

select rows from a database based on only title and time

SELECT title, time  
  FROM table
GROUP BY title, time
  HAVING count(*) > 1

## select max value from group

SELECT id, MAX(rev)
FROM YourTable
GROUP BY id

if need other columns:

Joining with simple group-identifier, max-value-in-group Sub-query

In this approach, you first find the group-identifier, max-value-in-group (already solved above) in a sub-query. Then you join your table to the sub-query with equality on both group-identifier and max-value-in-group:

SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents
FROM YourTable a
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT id, MAX(rev) rev
    FROM YourTable
    GROUP BY id
) b ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev = b.rev
